# Fake-News-Detection-Using-Naive-Bayes
We have created a model to determine if a piece of news is fake or not, based on its title. We have used 3 Naïve Bayes algorithms, namely Gaussian, Bernoulli and Multinomial.

**About Dataset**

The dataset that we have used is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset) and submitted by [Clément Bisaillon](https://www.kaggle.com/clmentbisaillon)

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset

The zip file contains two csv files


*   Fake.csv
*   True.csv

Both files contain 4 columns. Fake.csv contains 23481 rows and True.csv contains 21417 rows.

###About The Model
Naïve Bayes has proven to not only be simple but also fast, accurate, and reliable Machine Learning algorithm, that works really well with `Natural Language Processing (NLP)`-related problems.

Naïve Bayes is a probabilistic machine learning algorithm based on the Bayes Theorem, used in a wide variety of classification tasks.

**Bayes Theorem**

Bayes Theorem is conditional probability is a measure of the probability of an event occurring given that another event has (by assumption, presumption, assertion, or evidence) occurred.
